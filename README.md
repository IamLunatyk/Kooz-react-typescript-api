Quiz App
I created a quiz application in React with TypeScript that allows users to:

Select the difficulty level and question range.
Answer questions that are dynamically fetched from an external API.
View the final score with the total of correct answers at the end.
How to Run the Project Locally
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Skopiuj kod
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Skopiuj kod
cd project-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Skopiuj kod
npm install
Run the application in development mode:

bash
Skopiuj kod
npm start
The app should open automatically in your browser at: http://localhost:3000.
